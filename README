VRun is a clean Application Run Dialog,
written in Vala and Gtk.

Features:
	-	Text Completion
		VRun will complete the commands you type into
		the text field. ( 'fire' -> 'firefox' )
		Completion happens inside the TextEntryArea and
		without annoying drop down menus.
	-	Fork Support
		Newly created process runs on its own (no parent)
		VRun quits completely.
